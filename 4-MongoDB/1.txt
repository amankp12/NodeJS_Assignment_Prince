Question 1: Difference Between MongoDB Server & Node.js Server
Explain the difference between a MongoDB server and a Node.js server in terms of their roles and
functionalities. Provide examples of situations where you would use each server type.


The MongoDB server is responsible for storing and managing data in the MongoDB database.
It handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations. On the other hand, a Node.js server is a runtime
environment that executes JavaScript code.
It handles incoming requests from clients, processes them, and can interact with databases like MongoDB to retrieve
or update data.
You would use a MongoDB server to store and manage data, while a Node.js server is used to handle application logic
and serve client requests.
