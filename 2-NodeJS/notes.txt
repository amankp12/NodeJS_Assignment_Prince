Hello My name is Aman Kumar. I am a software engineer and currently working on my masterâ€™s degree in 
computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). In addition to programming, I have experience
with web development using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java Servlet, and Python.
I have completed several projects during my undergraduate studies that involved building websites from scratch
using these languages. These experiences have given me an understanding of how different technologies can be 
used together to create functional and visually appealing websites. One project that stands out was developing a
website for a local non-profit organization called "The Humane Society," which required creating a user-friendly
interface while also ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities. This project taught me valuable skills 
such as responsive design, SEO optimization, and social media integration. 

In terms of personal interests, I enjoy playing video games, reading books, and spending time with friends.
However, my main interest is in the field of computer science. This  passion for technology started when I was
just nine years old, when I built my first website from scratch  using HTML5. Since then, I have been constantly
learning new programming languages and developing websites to show case my skills.  One project that stands out from
the rest is called "Tic Tac Toe".
